            My name is Stefan Tagarski, and I am a 19-year-old student from Macedonia.<br/>
            As a computer science enthusiast,
            I find immense joy and satisfaction in exploring the ever-evolving world of technology.
            From a young age, I have been fascinated by computers and their limitless potential.<br/>
            The way they can solve problems, connect people, and reshape entire industries captivates my imagination.
            This passion led me to pursue a degree in computer science,
            where I can dive deeper into the intricacies of programming, algorithms, and software development.
