        Ever since I picked up a basketball at the age of 7, the game has been my passion and my constant companion. Through the years, I honed my skills and dedicated countless hours to training and competing. As a proud member of KK Roling 08 during my high-school years, I achieved numerous accolades and cherished memories on the court. Now, at the age of 19, I find myself proudly representing KK Rabotnicki in Skopje. It's an incredible honor to don the jersey of such a prestigious club and play alongside talented teammates. The journey has been challenging, but the love for the game and the support of my coaches and teammates have fueled my drive to continuously improve. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and remain committed to reaching new heights in my basketball career.
